## Hi!  ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year MSc. Biological Science and B.E. Mechanical Engineering student from BITS-Pilani, Goa, India. 

Currently, I am visiting the Intelligent Robotics Lab, (BGU, Israel) for my graduation thesis - and working on Human-Robot Interaction for Industrial Tasks. I work on Human-In-The-Loop RL (HITL-RL) for manipulation in industrial tasks. 


My interests lie in the intersection of Robot Learning and Human-Robot Interaction. I look forward to explore two things: 
>1) Robotic assistive devices as solutions to managing musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders. 
>2) Assistant robots that can perform (or assist in) super-specific tasks after learning the skill from an expert human user. 

For this, I am learning safe HITL-RL methods, continual learning, as well as personalization of controllers. 


In order to have robots helping us in our day-to-day tasks, we need to help them understand how to help us! And by us, I mean anyone, even a non-expert! This was something I have explored as a part of one of my graduation theses (another thesis coming soon;) -

I have also worked on prototyping robots, and I love to play around with 3D printers. Naturally, that also makes me good at CAD! (So, if you ever need a icosahedron dice ðŸŽ² for DnD, feel free to contact me!).
