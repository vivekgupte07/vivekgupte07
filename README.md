## Hi!  ðŸ‘‹

I am a final year MSc. Biological Science and B.E. Mechanical Engineering student from BITS-Pilani, Goa, India. 

Currently, I am visiting the Intelligent Robotics Lab, (BGU, Israel) for my graduation thesis - and working on Human-Robot Interaction for Industrial Tasks. I work on Human-In-The-Loop RL (HITL-RL) for manipulation tasks. 


My interests lie in the intersection of Robot Learning and Human-Robot Interaction. I look forward to explore two things: 
>1) Robotic assistive devices as solutions to managing musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders. 
>2) Assistant robots that can perform (or assist in) super-specific tasks after learning the skill from an expert human user. 

For this, I am learning safe HITL-RL methods, continual learning, as well as personalization of controllers. 

To incorporate robots in our day-to-day lives, we need to help them understand how to help us! And any person, regardless of their knowledge of robotics, should be able to comfortably instruct these robots. This is something I have explored as a part of one of my graduation theses (another thesis coming soon;) -

I have also worked on prototyping robots, and I love to play around with 3D printers. Naturally, that also makes me good at CAD! (So, if you ever need an icosahedron dice ðŸŽ² for DnD, feel free to contact me!).
